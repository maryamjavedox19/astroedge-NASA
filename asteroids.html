        <h3>Exploring the Enigma: All You Need to Know About Asteroids!</h3>
        <h4>What are they?</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Asteroids are remnants from the early days of our solar system, often
          referred to as "building blocks" that never coalesced into planets.
          They offer a glimpse into the conditions that prevailed during the
          solar system's formation over 4.5 billion years ago.
        </p>
        <h4>Near-Earth Asteroids:</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Some asteroids have orbits that bring them close to Earth. These
          "near-Earth asteroids" are of particular interest due to their
          potential impact hazard.
        </p>
        <h4>Asteroid Belt:</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt, a region between the
          orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This is where NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission
          visited the near-Earth asteroid Bennu.
        </p>
        <h4>Asteroids Hold Cosmic Secrets:</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Studying asteroids can provide insights into the origins of our solar
          system, the formation of planets, and even the potential for life
          beyond Earth. They contain valuable information about the chemical and
          mineral makeup of the early solar system.

        <h3>Meet the Most Notable Asteroids!</h3>
        <h4>Ceres:</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          he largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres is a dwarf planet with a
          fascinating history. It holds water ice, suggesting the potential for
          subsurface oceans and the emergence of life
        </p>
        <h4>Vesta</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Vesta, often called a protoplanet, is known for its distinctive shape
          and is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth. It offers insights
          into the early processes of planetary formation.
        </p>
        <h4>Bennu</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Bennu gained fame through NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which collected
          samples from its surface. This near-Earth asteroid provides a window
          into the past, holding clues about our solar system's beginnings.
        </p>
        <h4>Eros</h4>
        <p class="para1">
          Eros, an elongated asteroid, was the target of NASA's NEAR Shoemaker
          mission. It revealed details about its surface, composition, and the
          forces that shape these intriguing celestial bodies.
